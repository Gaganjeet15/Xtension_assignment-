# Xtension Assignment

This repository contains the solutions for the Xtension Assignment.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate folders for each task. Each folder contains two files:
- A `.py` file with the Python code implementation
- A `.md` file with an explanation of the code

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

To get a local copy of this project, clone it using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Gaganjeet15/Xtension_assignment.git

```

## Installation

Most tasks can be run directly without any additional installation. However, for Task 12 (API Data Fetching), you'll need to install the `requests` library:

```
pip install requests
```

## Usage

To run a specific task:

1. Navigate to the task's folder
2. Run the Python file using a Python interpreter, e.g.:
   ```
   python "Task_2 - Palindrome Checker\palindrome_checker.py"
   ```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.12.1
- `requests` library (for Task 12 only)
