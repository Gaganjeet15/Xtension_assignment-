# Implement any sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)from scratch.

## Bubble Sort

Explanation:
1. The functions takes an array or list as input.
2. In this there are two pointers i and j and using two for loop
    * The i or the first for loop will run n times (n is here length of the array)
    * The j or the second will run n-1 times.
3. In the second for loop we will check arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
    * Will swap the values if the values are not in order
4. Returning the original array after the swapping the values.
5. Time complexity: O(nÂ²), Space complexity: O(1).
